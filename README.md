# HMWK3 - (03 JavaScript: Password Generator)

## Description

This app enables users to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected so they can create a strong password that provides greater security. This project features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. It also has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Mock-Up
